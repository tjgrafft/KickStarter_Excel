1.	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
2.	What are some limitations of this dataset?
3.	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Given the provided data, I can conclude that Kickstarter campaigns in the journalism category are not successful. I can also conclude that Kickstarter campaigns in the theater category are the most successful—especially campaigns specifically focused around plays. Lastly, I can conclude that the most successful months to start a campaign are April and May.

One of the limitations of this dataset is the success or failure is only contingent on money raised—it does not tell us potential other factors of why a specific Kickstarter campaign failed or was canceled. Another limitation is that the dataset only tells us what country each campaign is from. We can’t break it down into regions, states, or demographics. 

We could also create a pie chart, as that would be a good representation of how the percentages and the state of the campaign compares to the overall dataset. We could also include trendlines on the charts, to help recognize a trend/draw any correlations. We might also consider running a regression to see if we can find a correlation between pledged amount and state.
